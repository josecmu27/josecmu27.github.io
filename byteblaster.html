        Byteblaster was my final project for my Understanding Game Engines course. 
        Growing up I have been a fan of 2D platformer games and wanted to develop one where
        the main mechanic will be shooting enemies like the MegaMan games. 
        
        The reason why I decided to go this route was because I wanted to make a game where all
        the assets I found could blend in naturally. Fortunately, the Cyberpunk assets form CraftPix where great for this concept. 
      </p>

        The goals of the project was to develop three levels, final boss scene, collectibles, two enemies, and the player mechanics.
        My favorite part of this project was coming up with ideas on how I believe the enemies and boss would encounter the player since 
        I already had the assets. I first started with the simplest enemy which just patrolled from point to point. 
        Then, I started with an enemy that can also patrol, but will shoot a tennis ball when the player is in range. Finally, for the boss enemy, 
        I wanted it to start chasing the player and, when the player jumps over it, decelerate and turn to continue chasing the player. 

      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        My second favorite part was programming the player's movement. I followed tutorials on how to make fluid 2D platformer character movement, 
        and how the shooting mechanic would work. I ended up deciding that the player will only be able to shoot while on the ground since I had no 
        sprites for the player shooting in the air. Therefore, to deal for first enemy (small) the player must avoid them or jump on their head, 
        to overcome the 2 enemy (medium) the player will use their blaster, and for the third enemy (boss) they would both dodge and use their blaster.
