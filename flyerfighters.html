      FlyerFighters was a semester-long project developed for <strong>Advanced Game Studio</strong> at Carnegie Mellon University, 
      where I collaborated with a cross-disciplinary team of five including programmers, artists, and a product manager. 
      The game was themed around an imaginative firefighter experience set in a futuristic city, where players used unique traversal 
      mechanics to fly around and save civilians.

      The concept grew out of early prototyping sessions, where we experimented with different VR mechanics and traversal methods. 
      One particularly fun prototype involved flying with fire extinguishers, and this mechanic became the foundation for our game. 
      We developed the project in Unity using C#, combining strong technical systems with creative art direction to bring the firefighting theme to life.

      My contributions spanned programming, UI design, and level design. I implemented a Game Manager that handled core systems such as 
      game states, player statistics, and save data, ensuring that players could maintain their progress as they explored the city 
      and rescued civilians. I also developed a slicing mechanic that allowed players to cut objects interactively using VR inputs 
      and collision triggers, which added variety and depth to the gameplay. Beyond programming, I designed and built UI elements 
      such as the title screen and selection menus to create a smooth and engaging player experience. I also contributed to the game’s 
      level design by creating a Hotel level, which challenged players to navigate vertically while rescuing civilians in a multi-story environment.

      FlyerFighters ultimately showcased the strengths of cross-disciplinary collaboration, combining innovative VR mechanics, 
      interactive systems, and strong visual design. Presenting the project as a complete prototype highlighted both the creative 
      potential of VR gameplay and the importance of teamwork in building an engaging player experience. You can checkout my contributions <a href="https://github.com/josecmu27/Flyerfighter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="font-weight:bold; color:#4da6ff; text-decoration:none;">
