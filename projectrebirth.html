        Project Rebirth is a post-apocalyptic action-narrative game where a lone bionic girl roams through massive, desolate megastructures. 
        The story unfolds through the world itself - atmosphere, level design, and fleeting encounters. This project is being developed via the CMU Game
        Creation Society where students form teams to develop video games throughout a semester. I am currently working in a team of 12+ people 
        and we are currently working for our beta showcase in approximately two weeks.

        Currently, I have been assigned to design and develop the puzzles. Taking inspiration from games such as The Legend of Zelda, I proposed a balancing puzzle where
        the player will have to pick up and throw boxes to scale platforms to lift themselves up to reach a key box to unlock the next room. Here is the design I came up with:
      </p>
      <br>
      <figure style="flex:0 0 45%; text-align:center;">
        <img src="assets/images/BalancePuzzleDesign.jpg" alt="Catalog View" 
            style=" height:350px; object-fit:cover; border-radius:8px;">
        <figcaption style="color:#aaa; font-size:0.9rem; margin-top:0.5rem;">Puzzle Design</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br>
      <p>
        The balancing puzzle is built around a hierarchical system of interconnected platforms, structured like a binary tree.
        Each scale platform can have up to two sub-platforms — a left and a right. The system dynamically adjusts:
        when one sub-platform becomes heavier than the other, the heavier side lowers while the lighter side rises.

        The player must strategically manipulate the system by picking up and throwing weighted boxes onto different platforms to alter their balance.
        By redistributing weight, the player can ascend through the levels of the tree, solving the puzzle to reach higher areas.

        Right now I have been able to implement the platforms reacting to box and player collisions and properly updating the weight of each platform.
        Here is a video showcasing my progress

       I am currently collaborating with team members responsible for implementing player interactions—such as picking up and throwing boxes—and for programming 
       the chain platform movement. I will continue developing the remaining puzzle mechanics, including the box key and target interactions, and addressing edge 
       cases in the current system
