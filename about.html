        <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> Hello! I'm Jose Lima, a software developer passionate about building engaging experineces 
          via game development and software engineering. I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems 
          at Carnegie Mellon University, and a minor in Computer Science and Game Design, where I have built my experience via course, 
          club, and research projects. I chose this path because I want the ability to create anything I can imagine and 
          provide people with engaging experiences via my work.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        My journey started in high school, when a friend contacted me to join a Hackathon just to try it out. I asked him
        what where we going to build, and he said we could build anything we want and decided to build a video game. I have always
        been a gamer ever since I have memory and they have been an important part of my life as they have provided me with 
        remarkable experiences and taught me to be adventurous. Therefore, I decided to join the Hackathon and I discovered a whole
        new world. Although it was a challenging experience and the final result was not what we expected, it made me want to learn how
        to build what I envisioned, and thus, my journey as a software developer started.

      <h2>Education and Extra Curriculars</h2>
      <p>
        At Carnegie Mellon University, I’ve built a strong foundation in software development via coursework in Model-View-Controller design, 
        Agile methodologies, Test-Driven Development, relational databases, and source control. Currently, I am collaborating with a team in 
        my Mobile App Development course to design and implement a semester-long mobile application, applying these fundamentals in a real-world project setting.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Additionally, my computer science studies have also strengthened my problem-solving skills through work with fundamental data structures and algorithms. 
        Currently, in my Computer Graphics course, I’m implementing core graphics functionalities such as a rasterizer and mesh editor in Scotty 3D, a C++ modeling and rendering package.

        Furthermore, I’ve also studied mathematics including linear algebra and calculus which has deepened my ability to reason about algorithms and graphics systems.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Regarding extra curriculars, I am the treasurer for the CMU Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. Where I manage the organization's budget and facilitate event programming. 
        Additionally, I am part of the CMU Game Creation Society where I have worked on game projects in teams throughout a semester. Furthermore, I play for "Magia Latina" at the CMU Intramural League every week.
      </p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        Gaming is my favorite hobby, some of my favorite games of all time include The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Celeste, 
        and The Last of Us. Recently, I have been Metroid Prime and Batman: Arkham Collection. 
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>
        I also enjoy collecting video games from past generations. My favorite parts of my collection include the Game Boy Advance with 
        Mario vs Donkey Kong and Luigi's Mansion for the GameCube which I played on my Wii. I'm currently trying to beat a good amount of the games
        I have bought over the past years, after that I will probably delve more into the 6th generation of gaming, more specifically checking out the Playstation 2 library. 
      </p>

      <br>
      <p>
        Another hobby of mine is soccer, I am a big soccer fan. I like watching matches with friends and family such as international competitions such as the Champions League and World Cup.
        I also like to play soccer, I am part of an Intramural team at CMU called "Magia Latina" where we play in the Intramural league throughout semesters. Our team won the league last summer 
        and we are aiming to win this semesters league. Besides the Intramural league, I also just play friendy matches during the weekend to relax and have a good time.
